# Fullstack App Template

The goal of this project is to create a simple template (including basic CRUD operations, auth, interactions between users) for multiple languages as a quick start, similar to Create-React-App. There is no special reason for it to be a blog app. I just think it's a good basis for a fullstack app, and I'd be able to change/rip out features as needed. Ideally, there would be multiple versions for different languages/frameworks, and they would be interoperable.

Currently working on a template for Typescript on both ends, using React/Next.js/ChakraUI and Express. Very basics done. Some of the other things I'd like are:

- Pagination for a user's blogs/list of users

- Better UI all around, especially for the profile screens

- A comment system

- A closer look at auth, both in terms of security, and making sure the front end routing on logout/login is cleaner

- Add better error indicators and validation for the login/signup modals
